# Machine-Learning-Tutorials

This repository contains all the machine learning tutorials that might be useful while trying to learn and get your hands dirty.
Below is the description for each of the tutorials uploaded here.

1. Classification Algorithms:
  - This is a jupyter notebook that contains implementation of all classification algorithms from Logistic Regression to Random Forests.
  - For reference, I considered the data and methodologies suggested by [mlcourse.ai](https://mlcourse.ai)
  - The work is still in progress for this notebook. I am trying to implement the boosting algorithms like XGBoost and GradientBoosting.
  - For quick reference, the data can be found [here](https://bigml.com/user/bigml/gallery/dataset/4f89bff4155268645c000030)
